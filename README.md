# Python API Homework 

## What's the Weather Like?

### Part I: WeatherPy

#### Description

In Part I of the Python API Homework assignment, I created a Python script that visualized the weather of 500+ cities across the world, which varied in distance from the equator. 

#### Observations 

Based upon this analysis, which is based upon data that is dated March 3, 2022, I concluded the following 13 observations: 

1.  The highest temperature was located at approximately -20 latitude and the lowest was located at approximately 70 latitude.
2.  There was a significant humidity cluster between the latitudes of 40 and 80. 
3.  There was a significant cluster between the latitudes of 80 and 100. 
4.  The highest wind speeds were located around the latitude of 40.
5.  There was a strong, negative relationship between latitude and maximum temperature in the northern hemisphere. 
6.  The higher the latitude, the lower the maximum temperature.
7.  There was a slightly positive relationship between latitude and maximum temperature in the southern hemisphere.
8.  There was a slightly positive relationship between latitude and humidity in the northern hemisphere.
9.  There was a slightly positive relationship between latitude and humidity in the southern hemisphere.
10. There was a slightly positive relationship between latitude and cloudiness in the northern hemisphere.
11. There was a slightly positive relationship between latitude and cloudiness in the southern hemisphere.
12. There was a a slightly positive relationship between latitude and wind speed in the northern hemisphere.
13. There was a slightly negative relationship between latitude and wind speed in the southern hemisphere.

### Part II: VacationPy

#### Description

In Part II of the Python API Homework assignment, I utilized the aforementioned Python script to plan a vacation. 

#### Deliverables

Part II of the assignment required that I create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part I. The heatmap is as follows.

Furthermore, I was required to find hotels in close proximity to cities that met the following criteria:

- a maximum temperature lower than 80 degrees, but higher than 70 degrees; 
- wind speed of less than 10 MPH; and 
- zero cloudiness. 

Next, I was required to create a heat map that plotted the hotels. The heat map is as follows.
